            <h1 class="major">Five dangers you should consider before or while using Snapchat</h1>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/backgroundArticle_1.png" alt="" height="600"/></span>
            <p>1. A false sense of security</p>
            <p>Many people have a false sense of security when using Snapchat. They are convinced that the messages they
                send disappear and that there are no more traces. But the real danger is that they can share
                embarrassing videos or photos and the receiver can save them using other apps or devices. That's why
                it's very important to be more careful about the content we share on Snapchat. Especially for teenagers.
                Parents can be made aware and informed to have a discussion with their children and talk to them about
                the consequences this can bring.
            </p>
            <p>2. Cyberbullying</p>
            <p>Cyber bullying or cyber harassment is a common phenomenon on all social media that everyone should be
                aware of. What kind of harassment do people experience on Snapchat? Knowing that Snapchat allows its
                users to send ephemeral messages, stalkers use Snapchat to harass people without leaving a trace. Thus,
                victims, even if they decide to file a complaint, have no evidence.</p>
            <p>3. Easy connection with strangers and the dangers of Snapchat</p>
            <p>With Snapchat, you can connect with anyone, without any control. Knowing that you can share your location
                with your network, it is very dangerous to use this feature. Your entire network, even people you don't
                know, can have access to your location in real time. The danger, as it has already happened, is that in
                case of a conflict, everyone in your network knows where you live.</p>
            <p>4. Screen time addiction - gamifying time spent on the app with Snapstreaks</p>
            <p>As we saw earlier, Snapstreaks encourage users to log in every day and share snaps with their friends
                every day. Snapstreaks can get people addicted to Snapchat and create long-term stress that is hard to
                get rid of.</p>
            <p>5. Mental health - creating unrealistic image expectations with filters and selfie edits</p>
            <p>Snapchat is the source of the famous unrealistic lenses and filters. Many users became addicted to these
                filters, as some could no longer accept their real faces. Many resorted to plastic surgery to finally
                look like their filters or just look like the celebrities who use filters.</p>
