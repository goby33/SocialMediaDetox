          <p>Snapchat is a social media platform that allows you to share videos, photos and messages with your network. The particularity of Snapchat is that you can send messages that self-destruct after being read by the recipient. According to wikipedia, "Snapchat (or Snap in common parlance) is a free photo and video sharing application from the company Snap Inc. available on iOS and Android mobile platforms."(1)</p>
        <b>History</b>
            <p>Snapchat was founded in 2011 by a group of students at Stanford University in California. Franck Reginald "Reggie" Brown first introduced the idea of sending ephemeral photos. Two other students, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, joined him to develop the idea and make it a reality. They were inspired by the Anthony Weiner case, who had to resign after sending sexually suggestive photos to women.</p>

            <p>In October 2014, 4.6 million Snapchat accounts were hacked after Gibson Security, a security firm, was informed of the app's vulnerabilities.(2) Since the attack, Snapchat's security has been improved.</p>
        <p>In 2016, Snapchat introduced its first connected glasses and changed its name to Snap Inc.(3)</p>
            <b>Statistics (4)</b>
            <p>Snapchat is accessible since 13 years old. But there is no age verification.</p>
            <p>More than 3.5 billion snaps are sent every day around the world. Behind these ephemeral messages, there are 347 millions daily active users, for the year 2022. If we compare this data with the Snapchat statistics of 2021, we see an increase of 18%. Snapchat usage by world regions is as follows:</p>
       <ul>

           <li>86 millions users in Europe, 10% more than in 2021</li>
           <li>99 millions in the US, 4% more than the previous year</li>
           <li>162 millions in the rest of the world, an increase of 35% compared to 2021 (source).</li>
       </ul>

            <p>In addition, Snapchat has 500 millions monthly active users worldwide.</p>

            <p>The social network benefits from 3‚ÅÑ4 of so-called exclusive users. These do not have accounts on competing social networks: Instagram and/or Facebook. More precisely, 38% of Snapchat users do not have Instagram (source). They are true brand ambassadors, and therefore a target of users to retain over the long term.</p>
<p>The age ranges of Snapchat's global audience are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>21,1% de 13-17 ans</li>
    <li>39% de 18-24 ans</li>
    <li>22% de 25-34 ans</li>
    <li>13,4% de 35-49 ans</li>
    <li>3,7% de plus de 50 ans</li>
</ul>
            <b>How does it work?</b>
            <p>To sign up for Snapchat, you need to provide some personal data such as your name, email, date of birth. You can add friends to your network, send messages, create text groups, etc.</p>
<p>Not all messages are destructed every time. If you set a time limit for an instant message, it will disappear after being viewed. However, receivers can take a screenshot of an image using their phone or a third-party screenshot application. A screenshot taken with a phone will inform the sender that the image has been captured. Third-party applications, on the other hand, do not trigger a notification.</p>
           <p>The second is a feature called Snap Map that allows you to share a local location in real time. Friends in your network who have Snap Map enabled will also see your location. You can also share stories on Snapchat.</p>
<p>You can use multiple face lenses when taking photos. If you've ever seen photos of people with cartoon cat ears and whiskers on their faces, those are facial lenses. Global lenses are augmented reality elements, such as rainbows, that you can add to a photo to make it look like they are part of the photo.</p>

<p>Snapcash: Like PayPal or Venmo, Snapcash allows users to transfer money to each other.</p>
            <p>Memories: If you don't want your photos to disappear, you can store them to send them later.</p>
            <p>Snapstore: This is exactly what it sounds like: a place to buy Snapchat-related items.</p>

            <p>Shazam: A feature that helps you identify a song.</p>
            <p>Snapstreaks : ‚ÄúIf you see the üî• emoticon next to your friend's name on the Chat screen, it means that you and your friend are in Snapflame mode. That is, you have mutually exchanged Snaps (not Chats) within a 24-hour interval, for three consecutive days.</p>
           <p>The number next to that emoji üî•  indicates the current duration of your Snapstreak mode For example, if an "8" is displayed next to the üî• , you and your friend have exchanged Snaps (not Chats) for 8 days. (A pretty impressive number, we must admit!)</p>
            <p>To stay in Snapstreak mode, the two Snapchatters must each send each other a Snap (not a Chat) at least every 24 hours.</p>
            <p>If your Snapstreak with a friend is about to end, you will see a ‚è≥ symbol appear next to their name.</p>
            <p>Snaps sent to a group are not counted for the Snapstreak mode you can have individually with other users üòâ ‚Äù5</p>
