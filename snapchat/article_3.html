            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/img_3.png" alt="" height="600"/></span>
            <p>As with all social networks, it cannot be said that there is guaranteed security. Only a responsible use
                can guarantee a certain level of security.</p>
            <p>Here are some tips that can help to protect ourselves while using snapchat :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sign up with the correct age</li>
                <li>Set rules around friends</li>
                <li>Know where to report</li>
                <li>Know what is ok or not to share</li>
                <li>Explore the safety features</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How do snapchat help you to stay safe?</h2>
            <h3>1. Family centre</h3>
            <p>Snapchat’s family centre gives you an overview of your child’s activity on the app. By linking your
                account to your child's, you can see a list of their friends and who they have contacted in the last
                seven days – but not the content of those messages. Family centre also gives you access to a
                confidential reporting service that allows you to report any concerns directly to Snapchat’s Trust and
                Safety team.</p>
            <h3>2. Ghost mode</h3>
            <p>Enabling this will stop other users from seeing your location. To edit location settings, go to the cog
                button in the right-hand corner of the screen. Then enable ‘Ghost mode’ and select ‘until switched off’
                to make sure it stays enabled.</p>
            <h3>3. Limit contact from adult users</h3>
            <p>Snapchat has introduced restrictions to help limit unwanted contact from adults to kids. Adults will not
                be allowed to add young people who are 17 and under unless they have a certain number of friends in
                common. This won’t stop all contact from adults, but it will help to limit it.</p>
            <h3>4. Privacy settings</h3>
            <p>There are different privacy settings available that will help to limit who can see your account and
                contact you. Who can contact me – This lets you manage who can contact you. Who can view my story – Here
                you can block specific people from viewing your story. To explore the different privacy settings
                available, select the cog in the right-hand side of the screen and select ‘Privacy’.</p>

            <h3>5. Default chat functions</h3>
            <p>By default, you can’t chat to someone on Snapchat unless you are friends. Make sure to know people you
                accept friend requests from.</p>
            <h3>6. Reporting</h3>
            <p>To report another user, press and hold on their Snapchat ID, select ‘More’ and ‘Report’.</p>
