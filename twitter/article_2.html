            <p>Just as the rest of social medias, Twitter has its limitations and risks.
                An obvious limitation is the limit of 280 characters, forcing users to get quickly to the point and making it challenging to communicate about complex subjects or ideas. Moreover, it was only a 140 characters limit until 2017 so it was even harder for people to express themselves back then and eventually people got around that by replying to their initial tweet and replying again as many times as needed, creating “threads”.</p>

            <p>Another con of Twitter is how easy it is to spread misinformation on the platform, for instance you could use a trending hashtag in your tweet to make it more visible and reach a wider audience while spreading false information, users would basically do all the work for you, combined with the use of bots it is child’s play to make fake news trend.
                Furthermore, since now anyone can get a verified checkmark by subscribing to Twitter Blue, impersonation has increased a lot, anyone can create a fake account of someone else, get the verified checkmark and spread misinformation in order to harass that person or degrade their reputation.</p>

            <p>Of course privacy is always a concern when it comes to social medias, Twitter isn’t much different, users don’t have to follow you to see your tweets but you can protect them by only allowing your followers to see your tweets. Thankfully, it has gotten better recently with the additions of some features such as circles, allowing you to share a tweet with only a close group of your followers.</p>

            <p>Then comes cyberbullying and harassment, Twitter is a platform known for abusive behavior, and users may be subjected to harassment, hate speech, and cyberbullying.</p>

            <p>One last concern would be about accounts security, many accounts are targeted by cyber attacks and are then used as bot accounts to spread misinformation, malicious links or to post advertisements, usually about bitcoins scam (see 2020 Twitter account hijacking).</p>
