            <p>Social comparison is a common behavior on social media, where users compare their lives to those of their
                friends and acquaintances. On Facebook, social comparison can have negative consequences on users'
                mental health and well-being. Here are some key figures that illustrate the extent of this
                phenomenon.</p>
            <p>Firstly, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania, social comparison on Facebook can be a
                source of stress and anxiety for users, especially for those who spend a lot of time on the platform.
                The study found that users who spend more time on Facebook tend to compare themselves more to their
                friends, which can lead to feelings of jealousy and inferiority.</p>
            <p>In addition, a study by the Pew Research Center found that 69% of Facebook users have seen friends post
                content that made them feel uncomfortable or inadequate. Furthermore, according to a survey by the Royal
                Society for Public Health in the UK, social media, including Facebook, was ranked as the worst influence
                on young people's body image.</p>
            <p>However, it should be noted that social comparison on Facebook can also have positive effects, such as
                motivation to achieve personal goals and the opportunity to connect with friends and acquaintances with
                similar interests.</p>
            <p>Finally, Facebook has implemented measures to combat social comparison, such as the ability to hide posts
                from specific friends or reduce the amount of content that appears in the news feed. However, it is
                important for users to be aware of the potential negative effects of social comparison on Facebook and
                to take steps to protect their mental health and well-being.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, social comparison is a common behavior on Facebook, which can have negative consequences
                on users' mental health and well-being. Although Facebook has implemented measures to combat social
                comparison, it is important for users to also take measures to protect themselves from the potential
                negative effects of this behavior.</p>
