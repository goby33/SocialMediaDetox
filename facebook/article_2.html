            <p>Facebook has become a central element of many users' online social lives. However, excessive use of
                Facebook can have harmful effects on mental health, such as addiction. Here are some key figures that
                illustrate the extent of this phenomenon.</p>
            <p>Firstly, numerous studies have shown that excessive use of Facebook can lead to addiction, similar to
                that of other addictive behaviors such as drug use or gambling. According to a study by the University
                of Chicago, using Facebook can activate the same brain regions as those involved in addiction.
                Additionally, a study by the University of Vienna found that Facebook users can develop withdrawal
                symptoms similar to those of people with addictions.</p>
            <p>In terms of figures, a Pew Research Center study found that nearly 74% of Facebook users visit the site
                daily, while 51% log in multiple times a day. Furthermore, a survey by the Royal Society for Public
                Health in the UK ranked Facebook as the second most likely site to cause addiction, after YouTube.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Facebook uses persuasive design techniques to encourage prolonged use of the platform. For
                example, constant notifications, likes, comments, and shares can reinforce the feeling of social
                connection and encourage users to stay connected for longer.</p>
            <p>Finally, addiction to Facebook can have negative consequences on mental health, such as depression,
                anxiety, and social isolation. A study by the University of Michigan found that excessive use of
                Facebook can have a negative impact on overall well-being and life satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Facebook addiction is a growing problem, with many users visiting the site daily and
                engaging in compulsive behaviors. Facebook's persuasive design techniques can reinforce excessive use of
                the platform, which can have negative consequences on mental health and overall well-being.</p>
