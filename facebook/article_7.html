            <p>Facebook is a platform that can have negative effects on human psychology, such as addiction,
                cyberbullying, social comparison, altered self-perception, and exposure to traumatic content. However,
                there are ways to minimize these negative effects and protect one's mental health and well-being.</p>
            <p>Firstly, it is important to limit the time spent on Facebook and use notifications to reduce dependence.
                Users can also disable notifications for social media apps and limit the time they spend on these
                apps.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is important to report online harassment and block users who bully others. Users can also
                report inappropriate and violent content on Facebook to protect their mental health and well-being.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is important to avoid social comparison and focus on one's own achievements and goals.
                Users can also follow inspiring and positive people to motivate themselves to reach their goals.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is important to be honest about one's successes and failures and not try to present an
                idealized image of oneself on Facebook. Users can also focus on their real-life relationships and
                activities to improve their mental health.</p>
            <p>Finally, users should be aware of traumatic content and limit their exposure to such content by reporting
                inappropriate content and avoiding groups or pages that post violent or shocking content.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Facebook can have negative effects on human psychology, but there are ways to minimize
                these effects and protect one's mental health and well-being. Users can limit their time on Facebook,
                report online harassment, avoid social comparison, be honest about their achievements and failures, and
                be aware of traumatic content to improve their mental health and well-being.</p>
