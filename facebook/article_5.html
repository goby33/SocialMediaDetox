            <p>Altering self-perception is a common issue on social media, where users can present a polished or
                embellished version of their lives online. On Facebook, this can have negative consequences for users'
                mental health and well-being. Here are some key figures that illustrate the extent of this
                phenomenon.</p>
            <p>Firstly, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK, social media,
                including Facebook, was rated as the worst influence on young people's body image. Facebook users may be
                influenced by photos and videos of their friends presenting perfect bodies and lives, which can lead to
                feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.</p>
            <p>Moreover, according to a study by Stanford University, Facebook users tend to present themselves more
                positively online than in person. The study found that users tended to present a more embellished and
                positive image of themselves on Facebook, which can lead to a distortion of self-perception and pressure
                to maintain this online image.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, a survey by Pew Research Center revealed that 43% of Facebook users had seen friends post
                content that did not correspond to their real life. Additionally, 39% of users reported seeing friends
                post content that made them feel uncomfortable or inadequate.</p>
            <p>However, it is worth noting that Facebook has implemented measures to combat altered self-perception,
                such as the ability to hide posts from specific friends or reduce the amount of content that appears on
                the news feed. Additionally, some studies have shown that Facebook users who have a positive self-image
                online tend to have a better self-image in real life.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, altering self-perception is a common issue on Facebook, which can have negative
                consequences for users' mental health and well-being. Although Facebook has implemented measures to
                combat this phenomenon, it is important for users to be aware of the potential negative effects of
                altered self-perception on Facebook and to take steps to protect their mental health and well-being.</p>
